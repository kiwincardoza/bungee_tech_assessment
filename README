This Repository is for the assessment held by Bungee Tech.

Below is the list of directories and their context.
1. code - Contains main.py (Code file for Python assessment)
2. logs - Contains main.log (Log file for code/main.py)
3. queries - Contains the queries for all the questions in the assessment
4. data - Contains MAIN_DE.csv (input CSV file) and q3_output.parquet (Python Q3 Output Parquet file)
5. tests - Contains basic unit tests for the python file

Below is the classification of the files in the 'queries' directory:
1. sales_q1.sql - Query for the first question (for Sales table)
2. sales_q2.sql - Query for the second question (for Sales table)
3. employees_q1.sql - Query for the first question (for Employees/Salary/Department tables)
4. employees_q2.sql - Query for the second question (for Employees/Salary/Department tables)
5. employees_q3.sql - Query for the third question (for Employees/Salary/Department tables)

ANSWER FOR THIRD QUESTION (Sales Table section)
For better performance, the Sales table can be partitioned on COUNTRY and CATEGORY columns. 
This is because the query uses Group by on these columns, and would be faster if the partitions need not be Shuffled.
YEAR based on 'SALE_DATE' column can be also added as a PARTITION column, and if the base table has huge amount of data (spanning many years), all the partitions need not be scanned (Partition Pruning).
YEAR based on 'SALE_DATE' column can be added as an Index for the SALES table, since the column is used in WHERE clause, and would help in scanning the records quickly for a specific year.


TO RUN THIS, please follow the below steps:
1. Python version - 3.9.12
2. Create virtual environment (python -m venv venv)
3. Install packages (pip install -r requirements.txt)
4. Run python file (python code/main.py)
